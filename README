GPSjake is a J2ME application developed mainly with the Nokia N8 in mind.
It allows the user to spatially register a UK Ordnance Survey map image (user must have rights to image and follow copyright requirements), show their position on the map using GPS and provides various navigation functionality including the definition of prompts played at way points and a trip computer.

I have posted it here, under terms of GNU GPL v3, for prosperity - it is no longer maintained.
